# foundation_of_artificial_intelligence

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of fundamental algorithms for artificial intelligence, implemented without the use of machine learning techniques. It focuses on classical AI approaches that form the building blocks for understanding and solving complex problems. These algorithms include, but are not limited to, search methods, optimization techniques, rule-based systems, and logic-based reasoning.
